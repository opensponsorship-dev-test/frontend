# React Front end

Was able to successfully create a multiple step form in React allowing the user to input all required fields. 

Set up a redux store for state management

Implemented GET and POST endpoints from the backend to load athletes and save new athletes. 

Data is validated on the server but I did not have time to set up proper error handling. 

I did not have time to design "a well styled profile" so I just output each athletes
